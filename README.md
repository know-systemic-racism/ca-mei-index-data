# Military Equipment Index
This is a list that describes the types of military equipment owned by California law enforcement agencies. It is drawn from actual military equipment inventories that were required by law ([Assembly Bill No. 481](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB481)) to be posted publicly. For more about this legislation and its importance, see [California law enforcement now needs approval for military grade surveillance](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/05/california-law-enforcement-now-needs-approval-military-grade-surveillance).
