Heckler and Koch MP5,MP5,"Developed by Heckler & Koch in the mid-1960s, the 9 mm MP5 submachine gun uses the same delayed blowback operating system found on the famous HK G3 automatic rifle. Reliability, accuracy, ease of handling, simple maintenance, and safety — all the elements of HK excellence are highlighted on the MP5. Firing from the closed-bolt position in all modes of fire make MP5 submachine guns extremely accurate and controllable.

All HK MP5 models are manufactured using time-tested Heckler & Koch technological invocation and superior materials. Barrels are made using cold hammer forging, a process pioneered and perfected by HK. Machined and stamped high strength steel and modern polymers make up the rest of the MP5. Continual product improvements over more than 50 years of production have kept the MP5 up-to-date and technologically current; it is firmly established as the world’s pre-eminent submachine gun among military and law enforcement users.

Over 120 MP5 variants are available to address the widest range of tactical requirements. A selection of optional trigger groups allow for single fire only, full automatic, 2-round, and 3-round burst options. The weapon’s unique modular design and a variety of optional buttstocks, forearms, sight mounts, magazines, and other accessories gives the MP5 extraordinary flexibility to meet most any mission requirement.",Category 10,Heckler and Koch,https://hk-usa.com/,Heckler and Koch,https://hk-usa.com/hk-models/mp5-2/,https://www.heckler-koch.com/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_MP5A3_re_6691b1ed48.png,1500,,

These gains in ballistic efficiency help the modern shooter stretch the effective range out to 1,000 meters or more. This highly accurate and durable rifle includes an adjustable gas block that allows for a consistent feel whether shooting suppressed or unsuppressed. The perfected bolt carrier group reduces overall recoil impulse and is easy to maintain and operate in all conditions.",Category 8,Daniel Defense,https://danieldefense.com,Daniel Defense,https://danieldefense.com/dd5-v4-762x51mm.html,https://danieldefense.com/media/catalog/product/cache/57787b00c9d0d809fcf82071201be77f/d/d/dd5v4_7.62x51_l_02-158-13210-047_1.jpg,7497,15-25,

40 MM FERRET LIQUID CS (6.7 GRAMS) ROUNDS,"FERRET 40 MM LIQUID BARRICADE PENETRATOR ROUND, CS","The Ferret® 40mm Round is non-burning and suitable for indoor use. Used primarily by tactical teams, it is designed to penetrate barriers, such as windows, hollow core doors, wallboard and thin plywood.

In a tactical deployment situation, the 40mm Ferret is primarily used to dislodge barricaded subjects from confined areas. Its purpose is to minimize the risks to all parties through pain compliance, temporary discomfort and/or incapacitation of potentially violent or dangerous subjects.
