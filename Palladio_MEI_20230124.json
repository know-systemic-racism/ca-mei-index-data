Firing from the closed-bolt position in all modes of fire make MP5 submachine guns extremely accurate and controllable.\n\nAll HK MP5 models are manufactured using time-tested Heckler & Koch technological invocation and superior materials. Barrels are made using cold hammer forging, a process pioneered and perfected by HK. Machined and stamped high strength steel and modern polymers make up the rest of the MP5. Continual product improvements over more than 50 years of production have kept the MP5 up-to-date and technologically current; it is firmly established as the world’s pre-eminent submachine gun among military and law enforcement users.\n\nOver 120 MP5 variants are available to address the widest range of tactical requirements. A selection of optional trigger groups allow for single fire only, full automatic, 2-round, and 3-round burst options. The weapon’s unique modular design and a variety of optional buttstocks, forearms, sight mounts, magazines, and other accessories gives the MP5 extraordinary flexibility to meet most any mission requirement.","Category":"Category 10","Manufacturer":"Heckler and Koch","Manufacturer URL":"https://hk-usa.com/","Supplier Name":"Heckler and Koch","Item page URL":"https://hk-usa.com/hk-models/mp5-2/","Link to image":"https://www.heckler-koch.com/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_MP5A3_re_6691b1ed48.png","Cost":"1500","Life Span (years)":"","Notes":""},{"Listed Name":"Daniel Defense Mk18 AR-15/M4","Standardized Name":"MK18 PISTOL","Description":"The MK18 AR15 style Pistol is inspired by the original MK18, which has been extremely popular within the Law Enforcement and Special Operations communities.
